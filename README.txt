Login Instructions:
1.  You must first create an account by filling in the username/password fields and then clicking create.
    You will be notified if the creation was successful. If it is, you will be able to log in by
    clicking the login button.
2.  If you already have an existing account, enter your username and password into the respective text
    fields and click the login button.
3.  For two player login:
        a)  Log in the first player by filling in the text fields and pressing the button with the text
            "2 PLAYER LOGIN (1 OF 2)". This will clear the text fields and indicate whether or not the
            login was successful or if it failed to validate.
        b)  The button's text should now say "2 PLAYER LOGIN (2 OF 2)". Follow the procedure of a normal
            login and then click 2 player login button again to log in the second player. Note that
            if you click the "login" button instead, it will instead do a normal single player log in.
        c)  If your second login fails to validate, you can keep on reattempting until it validates, and
            it will log the account in as the second player and redirect you to the game select menu.

General Instructions:
1.  If you log in with 1 player, after playing each game, you will be given the option to submit your
    statistics of that run onto the leader board. Afterwards, you will be redirected back to the game
    select menu.
2.  If you log in with 2 players, after each game each player will be redirected to a screen displaying
    which user's turn it is next. Clicking on the screen will redirect you to either a different,
    randomly chosen game, or to the same game depending on if both player have had a chance to play
    the same game already or if one has yet to have the opportunity. You can return back to the game
    select menu at any time by clicking one of the game's exit buttons.
2.  The "LEADER BOARD" button unsurprisingly redirects you to the leader board screen, each game's
    button will redirect you to their respective game, and the "PROFILE" button will let you see your
    statistics (as well as those of the second player if you logged in 2 accounts) that you attained
    across all the games. Notably, this is also the only place you can see your attained achievements
    as leader board ranks submitted entries based only off Score and Currency*.
        *Because achievements can only be achieved once in each account's lifetime, it didn't make
        sense to rank leader board entries based on something like say the number of a achievements
        you attain in a given game.

General Card Game Rules:
1.  There are 2 types of cards, monster cards and spell cards, you can click on the available cards
    in your hands to either summon a monster card to your board or activate a spell card. Monster
    card has an attack value and a defence value, and a spell card has a special effect.
2.  Each player can only summon 1 monster card per turn and each monster card can only attack 1 time
    per turn, but spell cards can be activated without any precaution. However, monster cards can
    only be summoned to the board slot in front of them, and if it is occupied by another monster
    card, monster in hand cannot be summoned.
3.  Monster Card (Brown Border):
    Deep Red Card: Attack 100, Defence 2000
    Light Card: Attack 1800, Defence 0
4.  Spell Card (Green Border):
    Lightning Card: Destroys all card on enemy's board
5.  Turn Explanation:
    First turn: You can summon a monster, but the monster cannot attack, clicking next turn will
                cause the enemy to make its moves
    Second turn and onwards: You draw until your hand is full, you can summon another monster, and
                both summoned monsters can attack
6.  Battle Explanation:
    Clicking on a summoned card will trigger a dialog, where it asks the target of the attack. You
    can only attack the enemy directly if there are no monsters summoned on the enemy's field, and
    only attack enemy's summoned cards if they have any monsters summoned. Clicking any invalid
    attack target will not result in a successful attack and will not use up the once per turn
    attack of your attacking monster.

    Damage Calculation:
    When two monsters battles, if one monster's attack is higher than the attack of another monster,
    then the monster with the lower attack is destroyed, and the attack difference is dealt as
    damage to the player who summoned the weaker monster. If the attacks are equal, then mutual
    destruction occurs and no damage is dealt.
7.  Win and Lose Condition:
    A player will win if:
        The other player's health is reduced to 0 or the other palyer has no more cards to draw in
        their deck

    250 in each game, you wouldn't get an achievement that requires a score of 300)
